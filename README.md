# Python-Programming-Language-for-Test-Construction-Analysis
This project analysed the competency level of test construction among teachers in senior secondary schools in Edo State, Nigeria. Using Python, the analysis leveraged libraries like scipy.stats (ttest_ind, levene), pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn to assess teachers' proficiency and identify areas for improvement.
